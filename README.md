This is a variation of a classic Snake game written in Python using the Turtle module and OOP principles.

Goal:
- To achieve maximum score (eat as much food as possible) without any collisions.

Rules:
- Snake grows larger by 1 segment every time it eats the food.
- Every time it eats the food, the score increases by 1.
- Snake is not allowed to collide with the walls.
- Snake is not allowed to collide with it's tail.

How to play:
- Simply run main.py and enjoy :)
- You can control the snake's movement by using arrow keys.
